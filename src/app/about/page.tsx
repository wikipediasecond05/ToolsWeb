          <p>
            At {APP_NAME}, our mission is simple: to provide useful, fast, and free tools for developers, 
            content creators, and digital professionals. We believe that powerful utilities shouldn't
            come with a hefty price tag or a complicated user experience. We aim to build a collection
            of high-quality tools that solve real-world problems efficiently.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why We Built {APP_NAME}</h2>
          <p>
            As developers and creators ourselves, we often found ourselves searching for simple online tools 
            for common tasks â€“ a quick JSON format, a Base64 encode, or a line break remover. While many 
            such tools exist, they are often cluttered with ads, slow, or require unnecessary sign-ups. 
            We wanted to create a destination that prioritizes utility and user experience above all else.
            {APP_NAME} is born out of the desire for a clean, reliable, and accessible toolkit that respects
            user privacy.
